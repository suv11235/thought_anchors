Let me solve this step by step. First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. The question wants me to calculate the value of 66666 in hexadecimal and then find out how many bits that number would require in binary.

Let me start by converting 66666 from hexadecimal to decimal. In hexadecimal, each digit represents a power of 16. So 66666_16 = 6×16^4 + 6×16^3 + 6×16^2 + 6×16^1 + 6×16^0.

Let me calculate each term:
16^0 = 1, so 6×16^0 = 6
16^1 = 16, so 6×16^1 = 96
16^2 = 256, so 6×16^2 = 1536
16^3 = 4096, so 6×16^3 = 24576
16^4 = 65536, so 6×16^4 = 393216

Now I'll add all these up: 393216 + 24576 + 1536 + 96 + 6 = 419430.

So 66666_16 = 419430 in decimal.

Now I need to find how many bits this number requires in binary. I can use the formula: number of bits = floor(log2(n)) + 1, where n is the decimal number.

Let me calculate log2(419430). I know that 2^18 = 262144 and 2^19 = 524288. Since 419430 is between these two values, log2(419430) is between 18 and 19.

Therefore, floor(log2(419430)) = 18, and the number of bits needed is 18 + 1 = 19 bits.

Wait, let me double-check this. I can also think about it another way: each hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits, so 5 hex digits would be 5 × 4 = 20 bits. But this doesn't match my calculation.

Let me verify by converting 419430 to binary. I'll do this by repeatedly dividing by 2 and noting the remainders.

419430 ÷ 2 = 209715 remainder 0
209715 ÷ 2 = 104857 remainder 1
104857 ÷ 2 = 52428 remainder 1
52428 ÷ 2 = 26214 remainder 0
26214 ÷ 2 = 13107 remainder 0
13107 ÷ 2 = 6553 remainder 1
6553 ÷ 2 = 3276 remainder 1
3276 ÷ 2 = 1638 remainder 0
1638 ÷ 2 = 819 remainder 0
819 ÷ 2 = 409 remainder 1
409 ÷ 2 = 204 remainder 1
204 ÷ 2 = 102 remainder 0
102 ÷ 2 = 51 remainder 0
51 ÷ 2 = 25 remainder 1
25 ÷ 2 = 12 remainder 1
12 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 0
6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0
3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top: 1100110011001100110. This is 19 bits long, which confirms my earlier calculation.

Therefore, the number 66666 in hexadecimal requires 19 bits when represented in binary.
